# Welcome to our Course Repository!

Here you will find all the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts we use during the tutorial lectures. Materials will be uploaded before each tutorial, giving you plenty of time to work through them.

## About the Notebooks

Each notebook contains simple (non-mandatory) exercises to help you check your understanding of the content. Working through these exercises will reinforce the concepts covered in the tutorials.

## A Note on AI Tools

LLMs (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) can solve these exercises easily, and you're welcome to use them as learning aids. However, if you're new to programming, we strongly recommend:

1. Try solving exercises on your own first
2. Use AI tools to understand concepts or debug your code when stuck
3. Make sure you understand the solutions, not just copy them

**Why this matters:** Understanding the code fundamentals will make it much easier to diagnose and fix bugs in your own projects later. The goal is to build your problem-solving skills, not just complete the exercises.

## Getting Help

If you have questions or encounter difficulties, no worries! We will be there to help you during the tutorial sessions.

Happy coding!

# Schedule

**1. Block: Intro to Python**

During these four weeks we start from the very basics. At the end you should be able to: 
- Create your own notebooks
- Understand basic python principles
- Work with model data
- Create publication quality plots.

If you can already do those things, there is no need for you to be present during the tutorials. It is your own responsibility to be ready for the project work later on!

  -   Week 0 (10.3.): Install Python on your personal computers. Additionally, for those who are up to the challenge: Install git and create your own repository for your project. It is a very good way to backup your scripts and notebooks (not datasets, they are to large for github!) and have a version control system.

  -   Week 1 (17.3.): Python Basics
  -   Week 2 (24.3.): Numpy and Xarray: How to handle model data.
  -   Week 3 (31.3.): Plotting
      -   With a short presentation on how to make nice plots. We expect a certain quality in your reports!
  
**2. Block: Getting ready for your project**

In this block you figure out what you would like to do in your project and we show you how to download the necessary data. Additionally, we will show you some options on what you can do with your data

- Week 4 (7.4.): Downloading CESM-LENS data & Profiling your code

- Week 5 (8.4.): Data Analysis

- (Easter Holiday): You can try downloading the data you need for your project. It may take a while...

- Week 6&7 (21./28.4.): Choose your project/Data download support/Help with exercises.


**3. Block: Project work**
